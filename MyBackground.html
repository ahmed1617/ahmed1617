<p align="center" class="verdona"> I am from Pakistan!</p>

<br><br>
<p class="verdona"> I was born in Karachi, Pakistan. But at just 6 months old my parents came to America.
    My Dad spent most of his life in America whereas my Mother spent her whole life in my Birth place.
    After my parents got married, my father went back to America and shortly me and my mom followed.</p>

<br><br>
<p class="verdona"> I haven't been to my country in 8 years and I really miss it. Most of my mom's side of the family
                    resides there whereas my Dad's side are in America.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="verdona"> Both my parents are from Pakistan, and they always talk about how lively Karachi is. Many people
  walking to shops and kids running around with no care in the world. People of many classes, fashion and education
  coming together as one.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="verdona" > I may not connect with my Country to the full extent like my parents, however Pakistan is still apart of me
    and will live on in my culture and life!</p>
