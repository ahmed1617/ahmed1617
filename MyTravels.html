<p align="center">MY TRAVELS!</p>
<p> My Dad loved to travel before my Mom and him got married. He went to many places and
    met his relatives that are located all over the world. After getting married to my mom,
    and having me and my younger siblings, he stopped for a while.
    But we picked up his traveling inspiration later on. </p>
<br><br>
<p> For the past few years, since 2012, every Spring Break we made a tradition to go travel.</p>
<br><br>
<p> We have been to Tronto, Canada in March, 2012. My Dad's cousin and his family live there.
    I don't remember much, but looking back into some albums, I can tell I had a blast!</p>

<p> We have traveled to Las Vegas in 2014. Honestly, the first thing I ever saw in Las Vegas,
    was when we were looking for the exit out of the airport, was a casino. It looked really cool,
    and I was so surprised to see one so early and right when we arrived!

<p>In 2015, we traveled to London. This is actually our second time going to London. When I was three
   my sister was two, was when it was the first time for us. But this time was really special because
   now, we remember every detail of our travel there!</p>
<br><br>

<p> In 2016, we have traveled to Italy and Turkey. Fun fact, when I was in Istanbul, Turkey, my
    13 year old self thought that Istanbul was a whole separate country, located by Turkey!
    I kept stating this incorrect fact but my family didn't fix my statement. They thought it was
    really funny and kept letting me think that until my cousin showed me a map! In Italy, we went to Rome
    and the Coliseum</p>

<p>We traveled to Canada again in 2017, however, this time it was in Calgary. We had relatives living
    there and they were our guides around the lively city They showed us many cool things! But this time around,
    it was pretty cold and the province was covered in snow. Over all though, I had a great time!</p>

<br><br>
<p>March of 2018, we traveled back to Italy, but also went to France and Barcelona and Madrid in Spain. It was a pretty
    two weeks, going to three countries, but it was so worth it! We got to see such great cultures,
    new but delicious food and great places to visit to. My favorite places that we visited
    was the Effile tower in Paris and a Cathedral in Barcelona. </p>
<br><br>
<p> All in all, I am very grateful for my Parents for taking me and my sisters on such amazing and thrilling
    travels. This is definitely a tradition I love and I can't wait for our next travels!!!</p>
